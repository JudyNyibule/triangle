# TRIANGLE TRACKER

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/JudyNyibule/triangle)

## Project Description and Features
The Triangle Tracker [Triangle Inequality Theorem Calculator] is: A web page that allows the user to:

  - input and capture the lengths of the sides of a triangle
  - returns whether these sides form an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle
  - or if the sides cannot make a triangle at all.

The formula that decides whether the dimensions inputted make up a triangle or not is:

![Triangle Inequality Theorem Formula](https://www.mathwarehouse.com/geometry/triangles/images/triangle-inequality-theorem/imagestriangle-inequality-theorempicture-of-triangle-inequality-theorem-and-formula.webp)

Side lengths that do not adhere to the triangle inequality theorem: States that the sum of the side lengths of any 2 sides of a triangle must exceed the length of the third side.

EXAMPLE of a side that will not make a triangle: 4,8,3

## USER STORY:
1. WHAT: A form is provided on screen with 3 input bars for the 3 sides representing a triangle.
2. WHO: The user inputs 3 sides of a triangle.
2. WHAT: Once the sides have been inputed, the submit button sends the 3 arguments to a Javascript function isTriangle()  that checks [in order:]
## SCENARIO:
-Do the sides inputed constitute a real triangle?
    * IF TRUE [following the Triangle Inequality Theorem condition ] THEN a message displays to indicate it is a triangle and proceeds to display what type of triangle it is using the nested control flows.
    * IF FALSE, THEN a message displays to indicate it is NOT a triangle and program ends.
